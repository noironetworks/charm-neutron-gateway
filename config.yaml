  ext-port:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Deprecated: Use bridge-mappings and data-port to create a network
      which can be used for external connectivity.  You can call the network
      external and the bridge br-ex by convention, but neither is required.

      Space-delimited list of external ports to use for routing of instance
      traffic to the external public network. Valid values are either MAC
      addresses (in which case only MAC addresses for interfaces without an IP
      address already assigned will be used), or interfaces (eth0)
  data-port:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Space-delimited list of bridge:port mappings. Ports will be added to
      their corresponding bridge. The bridges will allow usage of flat or

      bridge-mappings.
      .
      Ports provided can be the name or MAC address of the interface to be
      added to the bridge. If MAC addresses are used, you may provide multiple
      bridge:mac for the same bridge so as to be able to configure multiple
      units. In this case the charm will run through the provided MAC addresses
      for each bridge until it finds one it can resolve to an interface name.

      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in Nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:

    description: |
      A comma-separated list of Nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup

  # Legacy (Icehouse) HA
  ha-legacy-mode:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True will enable Pacemaker to monitor the neutron-ha-monitor daemon
      on every neutron-gateway unit, which detects neutron agents status and
      reschedule resources hosting on failed agents, detects local errors and
      release resources when network is unreachable or do necessary recover

    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  harden:
    default:
